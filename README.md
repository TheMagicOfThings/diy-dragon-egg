This dragon's egg sits in a nest, and illuminates with a tap of your magic wand.

## Included Parts

![Parts](/Images/351B3863.jpg)

- 1x Magic Wand Sensor + Clip
- 1x Platform + LED Strip
- 1x UNO Controller
- 1x USB Cable
- 1x 3D Printed Dragon’s Nest
- 1x 3d Printed Dragon Egg

## Assembly

Place your UNO Controller into the Dragon’s Nest. Note the position of the 4 guide posts in the nest, and the 4 mounting holes on the controller. The big USB and power ports on the controller should also line up with the gaps on the back of the nest.

Take your LED platform, and place it on top of the controller. The two rectangular slots should, once again, line up with the big USB and power ports. The four round slots should also line up with the four posts on the inside of the nest.

Firmly press the platform down if needed, until the platform and the controller are secure.


Take a close look at the wires coming out of the LED strip on the platform. Note the three coloured tags on the ends.

These colours correspond with the functionality of each wire, and will determine which port (or “pin”) on the controller you’ll need to plug them into. Take care to carefully identify the pin before plugging the wires in. This should also be done with the controller unplugged from any power source.


The red wire provides power, and will go into the pin marked 5V.

The white wire provides instructions for the lights on the strip, telling them what colour, or behaviour to display. It goes into the pin marked 7. This is on the opposite row to the red wire.

The black wire is ground, and will go into either one of the two pins marked GND.

Great! Now, identify the Magic Wand Sensor. We’ve already attached it to a 3D-printed clip that will slot into place inside the nest. It looks like this:

With the wires sticking out upwards, and the little black sensor module facing the away from the controller, insert the clip into its slot. This might feel a little bit snug, so be careful not to strain the wires too much.

Once again, we’ll be plugging the different wires into the controller’s pins. Take time to identify the colour tags and pins before plugging the sensor in.

The red wire plugs into the pin marked 3.3V

The yellow wire plugs into pin 8 (conveniently located next to pin 7, where we previously plugged the LEDs’ white wire).

And finally, the black wire goes into the other pin marked GND.

Once you make sure everything is securely in place, and the pins are nice and snug, you’re ready to snap the Dragon Egg onto its nest, and plug the USB cable into the port, to bring this Dragon Egg Lamp to life!

The controller comes with some basic behaviour that illuminates the egg once activated with your magic wand, but the beauty of using a controller like this one is that you can add to that behaviour, and personalise it to really make this Dragon Egg Lamp your own. This can be anything from changing the colour of the light, to giving it multiple colours, or even animating it.

Check out our next guide to begin personalising the behaviour of the Dragon Egg Lamp.
